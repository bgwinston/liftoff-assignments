## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Dismissal Application will help users communicate with schools concerning their child's leaving school. I'm a teacher and I've experienced the fear of possibly loosing a student because when their parent arrived, the child was no where to be found.  I've also seen parents become inpatient with school staff because they came to pick up their child unannounced and they are on a tight schedule. 
This program will allow parents to communicate with schools concerning transportation changes and early pick ups. Parents will be able to login into their account, verify their child's information and choose the transportation change, and/or early pick up time. This will allow the school to be prepared for any students leaving early and will help keep track of how students get home just incase a parent can not locate their child. 
### Features
User Login- Users will login and create an account.
Student Search - Users will search database to find their child to connect to their account.
Change- User will be able to submit request for early pick up and/or transportation change
Log- Log page that shows all of the requests the user has made. This will serve as the users profile.
### Technologies
Java
MYSQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
A way for users to search the database of children using kid(s) name, grade, parent name, and teacher. Some kind of way for user to verify information found in database and for the information that is verified to be tied to that users account.  Possibly multiple users for a child so that multiple people that are authorized can input any changes.
